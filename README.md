# tab-converter
Python script that generates an audio file from guitar tablature

Requires:
- requests-html
- pydub

# Instructions:
In the terminal, run tab.py url_name, where url_name is the url of the site on ultimate-guitar.com that has the tab you want to use. If it is successful, then it will generate an audio file called tune.wav in the current directory that will correspond to the tab in your input. If it doesn't work, then there is probably something wrong with the format of the tab. If this is the case, then you can go to tabconverter.com to input the tab directly.
